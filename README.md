## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Development Tools üõ†Ô∏è

### Performance Monitoring
The project includes performance monitoring utilities in `src/utils/performance.ts`:

```typescript
import { measurePerformance, logPerformanceMetrics } from '@/utils/performance';

// Measure Core Web Vitals
const metrics = await measurePerformance();
logPerformanceMetrics(metrics);
```

This helps track:
- **TTFB** (Time to First Byte)
- **FCP** (First Contentful Paint)
- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint)
- **FID** (First Input Delay)
- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift)

### Performance Optimization Hook
Use the `usePerformanceOptimization` hook for adaptive UI:

```typescript
import { usePerformanceOptimization } from '@/components/hooks/usePerformanceOptimization';

const { isSlowDevice, prefersReducedMotion, isMobile } = usePerformanceOptimization();
```

This automatically:
- Detects slow devices and reduces animation complexity
- Respects user's reduced motion preferences
- Optimizes touch interactions on mobile devices

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14+**: React framework for production
- **TypeScript**: Static typing for JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Vercel Analytics**: Real-time performance monitoring
- **Lighthouse**: Automated performance auditing
